# EcoShare - AI-Powered Campus Food Sharing Platform

## Overview

EcoShare is an intelligent surplus food management platform that connects campus communities to reduce waste and feed everyone. The application uses Google Gemini AI to automatically categorize food items, assess freshness, and provide environmental impact insights. Users can share surplus food, discover available items nearby, and track their positive environmental impact through a comprehensive dashboard system.

## System Architecture

### Full-Stack Monorepo Structure
The application follows a monorepo architecture with clear separation between client, server, and shared code:
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript built using Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript support serving both API endpoints and static files in production
- **Shared**: Common TypeScript schemas and types shared between frontend and backend for type safety

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and modern React features
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing without the overhead of React Router
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management, caching, and synchronization
- **UI System**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component system for accessible, customizable components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens, CSS variables, and comprehensive dark mode support
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation for type-safe form handling and validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript for type-safe API development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM providing type-safe database operations and schema management
- **Authentication**: Google OAuth with PostgreSQL session storage for persistent authentication
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini AI for intelligent food categorization, freshness assessment, and environmental insights
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL-backed session store using connect-pg-simple for scalable session persistence

### Database Design
The PostgreSQL schema supports the complete food sharing workflow:
- **Users**: User profiles integrated with Google OAuth, including demo user support
- **Food Listings**: Comprehensive food items with AI-generated categories, freshness status, location, and availability windows
- **Pickups**: Reservation system connecting users with food listings including scheduling and status tracking
- **Notifications**: User notification system for platform activities and updates
- **User Stats**: Environmental impact tracking including food saved, carbon footprint reduction, and engagement metrics
- **Platform Stats**: Aggregate statistics for community impact visualization
- **Sessions**: Required authentication session management table for Google OAuth integration

### AI-Powered Intelligence
Google Gemini AI integration provides four core intelligent features:
- **Smart Food Categorization**: Automatic categorization into predefined categories (meals, snacks, beverages, baked goods, fruits/vegetables, dairy, other)
- **Freshness Assessment**: AI-powered evaluation with safety recommendations and optimal consumption timeframes (fresh, moderate, urgent)
- **Environmental Impact Analysis**: Carbon footprint savings calculation and personalized sustainability insights based on food waste prevention
- **Enhanced Descriptions**: AI-generated appealing descriptions highlighting nutritional value, preparation details, and serving suggestions
